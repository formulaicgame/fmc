# Example mod
This is meant to demonstrate how to set up a mod and does not show much in the
way of features. You are expected to find what you need in the game's docs and
source.

## Naming
If you publish your mod to crates.io please show consideration for the registry
namespace by naming your mod "fmc_your_mod_name". It will also help people
searching for mods, as they can search for the prefix.

## Assets
You can add your own assets by creating an `assets` folder, see the layout in [fmc_vanilla](https://github.com/formulaicgame/FMC-Vanilla/tree/master/assets) for how to organize it.  
They will automatically be included in the game when compiled.
